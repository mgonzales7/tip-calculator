## Notes

Had issues getting the emulator to work. Was using the 9.2 emulator at first but i downloaded the 8.1 emulator for use instead.
My computer has some performance issues running XCode and the simulator with both slowing down and freezing occassionally.
Solution is to potentially upgrade my 2012 macbook pro.
